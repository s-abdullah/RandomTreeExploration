# Rapidly Exploring Random Trees

This project implements the algorithm stated in this [paper](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~allen/F18/NOTES/LavKuf01rrt.pdf) by Steven Lavalle.
The probkem is simple, given a state space and a goal, find the paht to the goal.


## Problem and Pseudo Code
This is the problem formulation as stated in the paper and the correspononding pseudo-code that is implemented.
